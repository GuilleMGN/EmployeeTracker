# EmployeeTracker

## Description
This project is designed to allow a user to add, view, update and delete departments, roles, and employees within their business to keep track of everyone and maintain organization. The application runs in the console using Node JS and MySQL. 

### User Story
As a business owner, I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company, So that I can organize and plan my business

## Usage
To use the application, you would have to install the node modules ('npm init -y'). The NPM package dependencies are 'npm i mysql', 'npm i util', 'npm i inquirer' and 'npm i console-table-printer'. After installing these packages, you can put the schema and seeds into the MySQL Workbench to create the fundamental database. Once this is complete, open the Terminal/GitBash console and run the code 'node app.js'. This will start the app in the main menu screen that will ask the user what they would like to do in the app. After the user completes any function, they will always return to the main menu to do another task, or to exit the prompt.
